The \"Integrity Music\" and \"Time Life Music\"                   logos will be used on advertising whenever possible, and it is                   understood that neither logo will be used without the other                   with reference to the Product.\\n\\n      c.       Integrity\\'s responsibilities. Integrity will obtain master                   lease and print agreements with all third party owners of                   masters embodied in the Product at its own expense. Mechanical                   rates will not exceed [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the                   then-current statutory rate, and Print licenses will not                   exceed a prorated portion of [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the                   retail selling price, Integrity will also manufacture the                   Product and sell to TL its requirements for resale.\\n\\n--------------- /1/ Indicates information which has been redacted pursuant to a request for     confidential treatment.\\n\\n4\\n\\nSource: INTEGRITY MEDIA INC, 10-K405, 3/29/20',\n",

In the event that mPhase\\'s use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the          sole judgment of Lucent, may adversely affect Lucent\\'s rights to the          mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT          TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may upon written          notification to mPhase, terminate this Agreement.\\n\\n4.       mPhase agrees that it acquires no rights to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo          nor to the marks LUCENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING          DESIGN, by its use and that any use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo by          mPhase inures to the benefit of Lucent.\\n\\n5.       mPhase agrees not to adopt any designation which is confusingly similar          to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or Lucent\\'s marks LUCENT, LUCENT          TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN. Any attempt to do so          shall be a breach of this Agreement and Lucent may terminate this          Agreement without notice in the event of such a breach.\\n\\n6.       This Agreement shall terminate in the event of a significant change in          the management or ownership of mPhase or in the event mPhase is the          subject of any bankruptcy proceedings.\\n\\n7.       Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase\\'s Goods.          mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current          quality of their Goods.\\n\\n8.       If Lucent determines that mPhase\\'s Goods are no longer maintained at          the current level of quality, Lucent shall so notify mPhase, in          writing, and Lucent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.\\n\\n9.       mPhase agrees to allow Lucent to inspect the Approved Uses bearing the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo, to ensure that those uses reviewed and          approved pursuant to the procedure set forth in Schedule B continue to          be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\\n\\n10.      In the event that mPhase becomes aware of any unauthorized use of the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo or other Lucent marks by third parties, mPhase          agrees to promptly notify Lucent and to cooperate fully, at Lucent\\'s          expense, in any enforcement of Lucent\\'s rights against such third\\n\\nSource: MPHASE TECHNOLOGIES INC, 10-K, 9/11/2003\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nparties.
